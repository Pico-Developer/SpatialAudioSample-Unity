# Spatial Audio Sample
The PICO Spatial Audio Sample demonstrates the capabilities of the PICO Spatial Audio SDK integrated into Unity, showcasing comprehensive use cases for developers. This sample features a cartoon-style house scene populated with multiple audio sources and areas designed to exhibit various spatial audio effects, including spatialization, ambisonics, directivity, and the transmission and reflection of sound across different materials. Developers can adjust audio parameters both in the Unity Editor and at runtime via the menu UI, enabling them to explore, learn, and optimize high-quality 3D audio functionalities for their own creative projects.
